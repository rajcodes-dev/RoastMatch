# **RoastMatch**
A savage, text-based relationship & friendship roaster built in Python.

Enter any two names — friends, couple, siblings, celebrities — and get a brutally honest (but fake) Hinglish roast about their compatibility.  
Same names = same roast every time. Different names = fresh shade!

Perfect mix of humor, sarcasm, and desi relatability

## **Features**
- 50+ hand-crafted savage Hinglish roasts
- Deterministic algorithm (same names → same roast for shareability)
- Clean Object-Oriented design (3 classes: GameController, RoastEngine, UserInterface)
- Dramatic UI with suspense, borders, emojis, and attitude
- Input validation (no crashes on empty names)
- Replayable with sarcastic messages
