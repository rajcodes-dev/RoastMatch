# **RoastMatch**
A savage, text-based relationship & friendship roaster built in Python.

Enter any two names — friends, couple, siblings, celebrities — and get a brutally honest (but fake) Hinglish roast about their compatibility.  
Same names = same roast every time. Different names = fresh shade!

Perfect mix of humor, sarcasm, and desi relatability

## **Features**
- 50+ hand-crafted savage Hinglish roasts
- Deterministic algorithm (same names → same roast for shareability)
- Clean Object-Oriented design (3 classes: GameController, RoastEngine, UserInterface)
- Dramatic UI with suspense, borders, emojis, and attitude
- Input validation (no crashes on empty names)
- Replayable with sarcastic messages

## **Built For Learning**
This project was created to practice:

  *Clean project structure & planning*
  *Purposeful Object-Oriented Programming*
  *Separation of concerns*
  *Dependency injection*
  *User experience & polish*
  *Deterministic "randomness"*

No external libraries — pure Python!

## **Project Milestones**
1. v1.0 Completed — First fully working version
2. Added 50+ handcrafted Hinglish roasts
3. Implemented deterministic compatibility hashing
4. Added complete OOP architecture
5. Created dramatic UI flow
6. Added input validation & replay system
7. Added screenshots & demo output in README

## **Outcome**
This will mark my first documented achievement on GitHub and make the repository more professional and structured.
